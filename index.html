<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
This workshop is for any archaeologist 
who has data they want to analyze, and no prior computational experience is required. 
This hands-on workshop teaches basic concepts, skills and tools for working more 
effectively with data. It is loosly based on the <a href=http://datacarpentry.org>Data Carpentry</a> 
  curriculum (which is highly suitable for self-guided learning).
</p>
<p>
 This workshop is specifically for archaeologists attending the 2018 <a href="http://saa.org/">Society 
  of American Archaeology</a> annual meeting. It is sponsored by 
  the <a href="https://osf.io/2dfhz/wiki/home/">SAA Open Science Interest Group</a>.
</p>
<p>
We will cover common archaeological data analysis and visualisation tasks
 using modern and widely used tools in the R programming language. 

Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. 
  By the end of the workshop learners should be able to more effectively manage 
  and analyze data and be able to apply the tools and approaches directly to their ongoing research.
</p>

<!--
  AUDIENCE

  Explain who your audience is.  (In particular, tell readers if the
  workshop is only open to people from a particular institution.
-->
<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at archaeologists who are students and early career researchers.
  </p>
<p>
  The course is intended for archaeologists with no prior experience with R, 
  statistics, or any other programming language. 
  </p>
<p>
  Some basic familiarity 
  with spreadsheets would be helpful. 
</p>

<!--

  ETHERPAD

  Display the Etherpad for the workshop.  You can set this up in
  advance or on the first day; either way, make sure you push changes
  to GitHub after you have its URL.  To create an Etherpad, go to

      http://etherpad.mozilla.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site

  where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop (e.g.,
  '2015-06-10-esu'.
-->
{% if page.etherpad %}
<p>
  <strong>Etherpad:</strong> <a href="{{page.etherpad}}">{{page.etherpad}}</a>.

  We will use this Etherpad for chatting, taking notes, and sharing URLs and bits of code.

<!--
  SETUP

  Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
  section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
  and end easier to find.

  This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
-->

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
To participate in a Data Carpentry workshop, you will need working copies of the 
described software. Please make sure to install everything (or at least to download 
the installers) before the start of your workshop. Participants should bring and use 
their own laptops to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow 
once you leave the workshop.
<p>
Please follow these <a href=install.html>Setup Instructions</a>.

<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="coc">Code of Conduct</h2>
We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of 
background or identity. However, we recognise that some groups in our community are subject to historical 
and ongoing discrimination, and may be vulnerable or disadvantaged. Membership in such a specific group 
can be on the basis of characteristics such as gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical 
appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex, colour, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, citizenship, 
familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief, political or any other opinion,
membership of a national minority, property, birth, age, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate 
harassment of participants on the basis of these categories, or for any other reason.

Harassment is any form of behaviour intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort. Because we 
are a diverse community, we may have different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent 
behind actions. Therefore we have chosen to prohibit certain forms of behaviour in our community, 
regardless of intent. Prohibited harassing behaviour includes but is not limited to:

written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership 
of a specific group listed above causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through 
<p>
  <ul>
      <li>stalking, following, or intimidation</li>
<li>the display of sexual or violent images</li>
<li>unwelcome sexual attention</li>
<li>nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact</li>
<li>sustained disruption of talks, events or communications</li>
<li>incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm</li>
<li>continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop</li>
<li>publication of private communication without consent</li>
     </ul>
    </p>
<p>
Behaviour not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute harassment. The list above should not be taken as exhaustive but rather as a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate. All Carpentry interactions should be professional regardless of location: harassment is prohibited whether it occurs on- or offline, and the same standards apply to both.
  </p>
<p>
Enforcement of the Code of Conduct will be respectful and not include any harassing behaviors.
  </p>
<p>
Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
  </p>
<p>
This code of conduct is an adaptation of the one used by the Software Carpentry Foundation and is a modified version of that used by PyCon, which in turn is forked from a template written by the Ada Initiative and hosted on the Geek Feminism Wiki.
