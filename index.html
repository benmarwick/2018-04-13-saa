<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
<a href=http://datacarpentry.org>Data Carpentry</a> workshops are for any researcher 
who has data they want to analyze, and no prior computational experience is required. 
This hands-on workshop teaches basic concepts, skills and tools for working more 
effectively with data. 
</p>
<p>
 This workshop is specifically for archaeologists attending the 2018 <a href="http://saa.org/">Society 
  of American Archaeology</a> annual meeting. It is sponsored by 
  the <a href="https://osf.io/2dfhz/wiki/home/">SAA Open Science Interest Group</a>.
</p>
<p>
We will cover common archaeological data analysis and visualisation tasks
 using modern and widely used tools in the R programming language. 

Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. By the end of the workshop learners should be able to more effectively manage and analyze data and be able to apply the tools and approaches directly to their ongoing research.
</p>

<!--
  AUDIENCE

  Explain who your audience is.  (In particular, tell readers if the
  workshop is only open to people from a particular institution.
-->
<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at archaeologists who are students and early career researchers.
  </p>
<p>
  The course is intended for archaeologists with no prior experience with R, 
  statistics, or any other programming language. 
  </p>
<p>
  Some basic familiarity 
  with spreadsheets would be helpful. 
</p>

<!--

  held in the  NMNH - SIL Training Room - CE107. This is a secure building, and we will issue 
  visitor name badges at the door at 9:15 am so you can get in and out during the workshop. Please 
  bring a print-out of your eventbrite ticket to ensure you can get into the workshop. Drinks are allowed, 
  but not food (small snacks are ok).

  SCHEDULE

  Show the workshop's schedule.  Edit the items and times in the table
  to match your plans.  You may also want to change 'Day 1' and 'Day
  2' to be actual dates or days of the week.
-->
<h2>Preliminary Schedule</h2>

We will do an <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html">introduction to R</a>, 
then move on to <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/03-dplyr.html">analysing</a> 
and <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/04-visualization-ggplot2.html">visualising</a> 
archaeological data. We will be using the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a>, a modern, 
unified collection of R packages designed for data science. For a more in-depth coverage of topics of the
workshop, you may want to read <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/"><em>R for Data Science</em></a> by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.

  ETHERPAD

  Display the Etherpad for the workshop.  You can set this up in
  advance or on the first day; either way, make sure you push changes
  to GitHub after you have its URL.  To create an Etherpad, go to

      http://etherpad.mozilla.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site

  where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop (e.g.,
  '2015-06-10-esu'.

<!--
  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

  SETUP

  Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
  section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
  and end easier to find.

  This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
-->

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
To participate in a Data Carpentry workshop, you will need working copies of the 
described software. Please make sure to install everything (or at least to download 
the installers) before the start of your workshop. Participants should bring and use 
their own laptops to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow 
once you leave the workshop.
<p>
Please follow these <a href=install.html>Setup Instructions</a>.

<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.
